## Project Overview

This is the "10s" project repository. The codebase is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Architecture Notes

### Task Master Integration
This project references Task Master's development workflow commands. When the `.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md` file is present, its guidelines should be followed for development workflows.

## Repository State

This repository is currently minimal and does not yet have:
- Version control (not initialized as a git repository)
- Source code files
- Build system or dependency management
- Test infrastructure

When these are added, this file should be updated with:
- Build and test commands
- Code architecture and module organization
- Development workflow specifics
- Any project-specific conventions or patterns
